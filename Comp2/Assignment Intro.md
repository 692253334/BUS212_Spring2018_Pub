# Overview
The goal of this assignment is to connect you to the course repository in GitHub, and to have you complete a few commonn actions using the platform.

Specifically, after you have established an account and installed the necessary software on your computer, you will:
* copy (or "fork") the course repository to your own computer.
* download a very short R script from this assignment to your computer
* make a simple modification to the script
* "push" and "commit" your modified script back to your own private repository in our GitHub Classroom.

The big idea is to get the software running properly on your computer and verify that things are working properly. When you complete the steps, GitHub will notify me.
